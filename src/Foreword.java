/*To learn a programming language
  Location 168
  Understand:
    Core language (is it algorithmmic (procedural programming), functional, object oriented)?
      Functional: Evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data (Lisp, Sche, Clojure, Dylan, Julia, K, Q, Excel, Scala)
          (mutable: data that is liable to change) (A form of declarative programming, what information is desired
          and what transformations are required.) (This is what lambdas are for in Java).
      Object Oriented: Programming paradigm based on "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields and
        code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
      Algorithmic (procedural) (imperative) programming: Procedures (routines, subroutines, or functions (not mathematical functions,
        but similar to those used in functional programming)), that contain a serires of computational steps to
        be carried out (Fortran, Algol, Cobol, Basic, Pascal, C, Ada, Go) (A developer writes code that describes in
        exacting detail the steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal.)

      Java, c++, python, Delphi are multi-paradigm programming languages that support OO programming with
        a combination of imperative/procedural programming.
    What data structures, operations, facilities are provided by the standard libraries?
    Be familiar with the customary and effective ways to structure your code.

      Grammar and vocabulary are properties of the language, but usage comes from the community that uses it.
    Ex) Java Programming language
      Object oriented with single inheritance
      Supports an inperative (statement oriented) coding style within each method.
